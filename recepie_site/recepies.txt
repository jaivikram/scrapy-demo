	Chocolate-Filled Almond Macaroons Recipe

>>>ingredients
	1 3/4 cups 
	

	1 (8-ounce) can almond paste (1 cup)
	6 tablespoons sugar, plus extra for sprinkling
	1 teaspoon almond extract
	1/2 teaspoon coarse salt
	2 large egg whites, lightly beaten, room temperature

	http://images.marthastewart.com/images/content/tv/martha_stewart_show/show_photos/5101_5200//5142_042110_macaroons_l.jpg

>>>serves
	Makes about 36 cookies

>>>directions
	Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick baking mats; set aside. 
	In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat together almond paste and sugar on medium-high until almond paste breaks down and mixture is well combined, 3 to 5 minutes. Scrape down sides of bowl. Add almond extract and salt; beat until well combined. 
	With the mixer running, add egg whites, 1 teaspoon at a time, beating well and scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition. The batter should be smooth and thick enough to pipe. 
	Preheat oven to 325 degrees.
	Transfer batter to a pastry bag fitted with a No. 4 (1/2-inch) pastry tip. Holding pastry tip about 3/4 inch above the parchment paper on prepared baking sheet, pipe a quarter-size round of batter onto parchment paper. Lift the bag off the batter a slight sideways jerking motion of your hand, producing a flat, rather than pointy, top on the cookie. Continue piping cookies about 1 inch apart, trying to finish with as small a peak as possible to leave tops rounded and smooth. Wet a finger with warm water to smooth out any remaining peaked tops; sprinkle generously with sugar. Let stand at room temperature 15 to 20 minutes so that a thin, crisp crust develops on outside of each cookie. 
	Transfer baking sheets to oven and bake, rotating baking sheets top to bottom and back to front two-thirds through, until set but not browned and still gooey in the centers, 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a wire rack; let cookies cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire rack to cool completely. 
	To fill cookies, place 1 teaspoon ganache on the bottom of one cookie, sandwich with the flat side of a second cookie. Repeat process with remaining ganache and cookies.

	1/2 teaspoon baking powder
	1/4 teaspoon salt
	1 cup sugar, plus 2 tablespoons for whipped cream (optional)

>>>serves
	Serves 10 to 12

>>>directions
	Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter an 8-inch-round cake pan; line bottom with a round of waxed or parchment paper. Butter paper; dust bottom and sides of pan with cocoa, tapping out excess.
	Sift together cocoa, flour, baking powder, and salt. With an electric mixer on medium-high speed, cream butter and 1 cup sugar until light and fluffy. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each and scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in vanilla. Reduce speed to low. Add flour mixture in two batches, alternating with the sour cream and beginning and ending with the flour. 
	Spread batter in prepared pan. Tap pan firmly on countertop once to eliminate large air bubbles. Bake until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool 10 minutes in pan, then invert onto a wire rack to cool completely (bottom-side up). Set rack with cake over a rimmed baking sheet. Pour glaze over cake, letting it run over sides; spread gently with an offset spatula or table knife to coat. Let set, about 30 minutes. 
	If desired, whip cream and remaining 2 tablespoons sugar with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Serve cake with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.

	Lemon Zest Buttermilk Fresh Cheese Recipe

>>>ingredients

>>>serves
	Makes 1 6-ounce round; serves 4 as a snack with bread

>>>directions
	Cut out three pieces of cheesecloth into 12-inch squares. Line a colander or medium strainer with all three layers of cheesecloth. Set colander in sink.
	Combine milk, buttermilk, salt, and lemon zest in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, and heat over medium-high heat until mixture has separated into white curds and translucent whey, about 8 minutes. If using lowfat buttermilk, separation occurs at about 180 degrees and the curds will clump together readily. If using whole buttermilk, separation occurs closer to the boiling point, about 212 degrees, and the curds are finer-grained. When using whole buttermilk, let curds and whey stand off heat for about 3 minutes after separation, so the curds cling together and facilitate the straining step.)
	Ladle the contents of the saucepan into the prepared colander. Let the whey drain, 1 to 2 minutes. Lift the four corners of the cheesecloth and gather them together. Gently twist the gathered cloth over the cheese and press out any excess whey.
	Serve unwrapped cheese warm on French bread, drizzled with olive oil and seasoned with salt.

>>>serves
	Makes 1 6-ounce round; serves 4 as a snack with crackers

>>>directions
	Cut out three pieces of cheesecloth into 12-inch squares. Line a colander or medium strainer with all three layers of cheesecloth. Set colander in sink.
	Combine milk, buttermilk, and salt in a large heavy-bottomed saucepan, and heat over medium-high heat until mixture has separated into white curds and translucent whey, about 8 minutes. If using lowfat buttermilk, separation occurs at about 180 degrees and the curds will clump together readily. If using whole buttermilk, separation occurs closer to the boiling point, about 212 degrees, and the curds are finer-grained. When using whole buttermilk, let curds and whey stand off heat for about 3 minutes after separation, so the curds cling together and facilitate the straining step.)
	Ladle the contents of the saucepan into the prepared colander. Let the whey drain, 1 to 2 minutes. Lift the four corners of the cheesecloth and gather them together. Gently twist the gathered cloth over the cheese and press out any excess whey.
	Cheese can be unwrapped immediately and served warm, or let stand until cooled to room temperature, about 10 minutes more. To serve a firmer cheese, transfer cheese, in its cloth, to a small flat-bottomed dish or pie plate; refrigerate until cool, about 10 minutes. Unwrap cheese and gently invert onto plate; discard cloth. Tent cheese with plastic wrap and keep refrigerated up to 2 days. Remove from refrigerator and let stand for 10 minutes at room temperature before serving.

>>>directions
	Preheat oven to 425 degrees with a rack positioned in the top third of the oven.
	Sift together flour and baking powder in a large bowl. In another large bowl beat eggs until creamy and yellow. Whisk in buttermilk, vanilla, 5 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar, and butter (mixture will look curdled and broken). Slowly add flour and whisk until batter is smooth and combined.
	Spray 8 standard-size (3-ounce) nonstick muffin pan cups with nonstick cooking spray. Divide batter evenly among prepared muffin pan cups, filling about two-thirds full. Transfer to oven and bake until sides of cakes are evenly browned (check by inserting a knife tip between the rim of cake and muffin cup, pulling gently to expose side of cake), about 9 minutes. If cakes are not evenly browned, they will not hold together when inverted. Continue baking, checking every minute, until evenly browned.
	Meanwhile, place raspberries in a medium bowl; add remaining 4 tablespoons sugar and gently toss to coat. 
	Invert cakes onto eight individual plates. Place berries on top and alongside cakes; serve with whipped cream, if desired.

	Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line two baking sheets with Silpats (French nonstick baking mats) or parchment paper, and set aside.
	Place food coloring in a shallow bowl. Using a small paintbrush, color one rounded half of each almond. Set aside to dry.
	Separate 1 egg. Set aside the white. In a small bowl, whisk together yolk, remaining egg, and vanilla. Set aside.
	In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine butter, confectioners' sugar, granulated sugar, and salt. Beat on medium speed until well combined. Add egg mixture, and beat until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add the flour, and mix on low speed just until incorporated. Wrap the dough in plastic, and chill until firm, 20 to 30 minutes.
	Divide the dough in half. Work with one piece at a time, keeping remaining dough covered with plastic wrap and chilled. Divide the first half into fifteen pieces. On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece back and forth with palms into finger shapes, 3 to 4 inches long. Pinch dough in two places to form knuckles. Score each knuckle lightly with the back of a small knife. Transfer fingers to prepared baking sheets. Repeat with remaining dough.
	When all fingers are formed, brush lightly with egg white. Position almond nails; push into dough to attach.

	Bread-and-Butter Pickled Green Tomatoes

>>>ingredients
	7 pounds green tomatoes
	1 cup pickling lime
	5 pounds sugar
	6 cups white vinegar
	1 tablespoon whole cloves
	5 cinnamon sticks
	1 tablespoon whole allspice
	1 teaspoon whole celery seed
	2 blades mace
	1 3-inch piece fresh ginger, peeled and sliced in 1/4-inch rounds

>>>image
	http://images.marthastewart.com/images/content/web/recipefinder/recipe4/sscon_01564_l.jpg

>>>serves
	Makes 6 pint jars

>>>directions
	Wash tomatoes thoroughly; cut away any bad spots. Cut into 1/4-inch-thick slices.
	Combine 2 gallons of water and the pickling lime in a large nonreactive bowl, and add tomatoes. Let soak for 24 hours.
	Drain tomatoes, and cover with fresh water. Soak for 4 hours, changing water every half hour. Rinse, and drain well.
	Make syrup: In a large nonreactive pot, combine sugar and vinegar, and bring to a boil. Fold an 8-by-16-inch piece of cheesecloth in half to make a square; rinse with water, and squeeze dry. Place cloves, cinnamon, allspice, celery seeds, mace, and ginger in the cheesecloth; tie closed with one end of a 12-inch piece of cotton string. Tie a loop in the other end, and slip it over the handle of a wooden spoon. Suspend spice bag in the syrup by placing the spoon across the top of the pot. Remove syrup from heat, add tomatoes, and let sit overnight at room temperature, covered with a clean dish towel.
	Remove kitchen towel, and transfer pot back to the stove. Bring tomatoes to a simmer over medium-high heat, and cook, pushing them into the syrup occasionally, until translucent, about 35 minutes.
	Meanwhile, sterilize the jars and lids: Place a round wire rack in the bottom of a large stockpot. The rack should fit as snugly as possible and should stand 1/2 to 1 inch above the bottom of the pot. Wash the jars, lids, and screw bands with hot, soapy water. Stand six pint jars on the rack, and add the lids; it's not necessary to add the screw bands. Fill the pot with enough water to cover jars by 1 to 2 inches; an additional 1 to 2 inches of space should remain below the rim of the pot so the water doesn't overflow. Cover, and bring the water to a simmer (180  degrees.; let the lids and jars simmer 10 minutes. (The lids and jars can continue to simmer until you're ready to fill them.)
	Using a jar lifter, remove a jar from the simmering water, and empty the water back into the stockpot. Place the jar on a clean surface. Using stainless-steel tongs, layer hot tomatoes in hot sterilized pint jars, leaving 3/4 inch of space beneath the rim. Pour hot syrup over tomatoes, covering them by 1/4 inch, leaving 1/2 inch of space beneath the rim. Slide a clean plastic chopstick or wooden skewer along the inside of each jar to release any air bubbles. Wipe the mouth of the jar with a clean, damp cloth. Place hot lid on jar; turn screw band firmly without forcing. Repeat with remaining jars and tomatoes.
	With the jar lifter, return the filled jars to the stockpot of simmering water, making sure the jars aren't touching the sides of the pot and are spaced about 1 inch apart.
	Raise the heat to high, cover the stockpot, and bring the water to a boil. Process the jars in the boiling water for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the water bath with the jar lifter, and transfer them to a wire rack to cool for 24 hours. As the tomatoes cool, a vacuum will form inside the jar, sealing it; you might hear a popping sound. A slight indentation in the lid indicates the vacuum seal; the lid should not flex up and down when pressed firmly with a finger. Store in a cool, dry, dark place for up to 1 year. The tomatoes can be served when cool but are more flavorful when allowed to mellow in a cool, dry place for 2 to 3 weeks. Store opened jars in the refrigerator.
